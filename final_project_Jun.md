This is my final project for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# **Vital Statistics Suicide Deaths by Age-Group, Race/Ethnicity, Resident County, Region and Gender**

## **Part I: Project Proposal**

### 1. Outline
Alcohol killed more people than guns. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, about 88,000 people die from alcohol-related causes each year, making alcohol the fourth-leading preventable cause of death in America. By comparison, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reports less than 33,000 people die each year from gun violence. First I will show the misperception most people believe, which is guns killing more poeple than alcohol. Then I want to compare the patterns and trends of two causes of death by analyzing the total counts and demographic characteristics of victims in New York State. After that, I will provide some suggestions to reduce alcohol-related and firearm fatalities. I will also point out the demographic characteristics of people who are highly like to become the victims of gun and alcohol.

### 2. Data
The dataset comes from the New York State Bureau Department of Health. [Click here to download the dataset](https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/j6fz-a4ta/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD). For more information, [check out here](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/vital-statistics-suicide-deaths-age-group-raceethnicity-resident-county-region-and-gender).

This dataset was collected from 2003 to 2016. It contains firearm death counts, and alcohol-related death counts, and suicide death counts by region (New York State inside and outside of New York City), race or ethnicity (Hispanic, White, Black, Other, Not Stated), sex (male and female), and age group (<1, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+). Here I want to focus on the death counts and demographical characteristics of victims of alcohol and firearm. I will be using some attributes to create a number of graphs. First, I will make a line graph showing the total dealth counts over time by 2 kinds of death. Line graph is an intuitive way to show the trends over time. Second, I will make bar charts for 2 kinds of dealth, with each one showing death counts by age group, by gender, by race, and by region over time. Third, I will make 2 alluvial diagrams showing death counts by region, race, sex, and age group for 2 kinds of death. Other kinds of graphs will be determined later.


### 3. Method and Medium
I will be building a story using Shorthand and making graphs using RAWGraphs. Shorthand is a tool to captivate audiences with fully responsive design, while RAWGraphs can help me identify patterns, trends and correlations in data and build quick graphs easily. They allow me to analyze data and communicate effectively.

Here is where all of my data visualization will go!


## **Part 2: Sketches, Wireframes, Storyboards and Moodboards**

### 1. Sketches and Storyboards
I used storyboad tying in sketches below to show the primary elements of my story outline and draft data visualizations of the critical elements of my story.

### 2. User Research Protocol
* the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
  
  The purpose of my story is to correct people's misperception about deaths from alcohol and deaths from guns in New York State. So my target audience are those who have the misperception.
  
* your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 

  Before I did the interview, I would first ask the potential representative individuals (my classmates and my roommates) a question: "In your opinion, which of the following led to more deaths in the New York State? Gun or Alcohol?" If they said gun, they would be the representative individuals and I would present my storyboard and sketches to them.
  
* your interview script; 
  
  All the questions are open-ended.
  
  1. Can you tell me what you think my story is about?
  2. Is my story logical?
  3. Are those charts easy to understand? If not, which one should be improved?
  4. Do you have any other comments?
  
* the findings from your interviews; 
  * Put two graphs Death Counts by Region and Death Counts by Gender together to reduce space and make it more informative.
  * Add some pictures or GIFs to make it vivid.
  * Change the title to make it more intuitive. It's confusing.
  * Alluvial diagram is not that informative and it's redundant.

* changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.

## **Part I**

### 1. Outline


### 2. Data
The dataset comes from the New York State Bureau of Vital Records. [Click here to download the dataset](https://health.data.ny.gov/api/views/j6fz-a4ta/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD) For more information, [check out here](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/vital-statistics-suicide-deaths-age-group-raceethnicity-resident-county-region-and-gender)

This dataset was collected from 2003 to 2016. It contains firearm death counts, alcohol-related death counts, and suicide death counts by region (New York State inside and outside of New York City), race or ethnicity (Hispanic, White, Black, Other, Not Stated), sex (male and female), and age group (<1, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+). I will be using all the attributes to create 3 graphs. First, I will make a line graph showing the total dealth counts over time by 3 kinds of death. Second, I will make 3 bar chart for 3 kinds of dealth, with each one showing death counts by age group over time. Third, I will make 3 alluvial diagrams showing death counts by region, race, sex, and age group for 3 kinds of death.

# **About Me**
Hey! This is Jun Zhang, 2nd year PPM student at Heinz. I have a strong background in quanlitative research. I've worked for NGOs such as United Nations Development Programme, government, and private companies as research assistant. I'm now focusing on data processing and data analytics, and this is mainly why I chose this course.

Travelling is a major passion of mine, and I spend a lot of my free-time planning out future adventures. I've been to many countries like  Egypt, Brazil, Russia, French, Germany, and Japan, and my dream is to travel around the world.

I'm glad to be in this class to improve my data visualization skills!

# **What I hope to learn**
I believe visualizations can make data meaningful and powerful. I hope to learn more about color theory, data processing and all kinds of data visualization tools. And the most important part is how to choose the best data visualization methods and how to interpret our findings. It would be better if we can have more Tableau hands on exercises.

Here is where all of my data visualization will go!
